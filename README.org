A tool for looking up APRS symbols. Search by description or code.

For example, if you wanted to see all symbols related to houses, type =house= in the search box.

Hovering over a symbol with the mouse cursor (or tapping, on a smartphone) will reveal the symbolâ€™s code and its description.

* To implement

- Symbol overlays
- Best practices tips (e.g. when to use or avoid using a symbol)

* Thanks to

This little tool would not have been possible without the work of @hessu. Check out his work at the following repos:

- [[https://github.com/hessu/aprs-symbols][aprs-symbols]]: this is where I got the images from.
- [[https://github.com/hessu/aprs-symbol-index][aprs-symbols-index]]: this was invaluable when building a list of all symbols.
